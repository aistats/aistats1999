Instructions To Authors For Preparing Final Copy
</h2>
<br>The proceedings will be published by Morgan Kaufmann and produced by Professional Book Center.  Here are the instructions from Professional Book Center for the preparation and transmission of your contribution.

<br><!-- To: All authors of accepted papers -->
<br>
<br><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
<br>Professional Book Center is very pleased to be participating
as the production service for the AI and Statistics '99
workshop proceedings. We will prepare the proceedings for
printing and supervise its manufacture. The following information
is essential for preparing your final submission. Please follow
all instructions as closely as possible.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE ON ELECTRONIC DELIVERY</strong>
<br>Due to the short lead time for preparing this Proceedings,
you must provide your paper to us electronically. You may
provide your paper either as a PostScript file suitable
for printing, or as an Adobe Acrobat PDF file. The Acrobat
format will allow you the maximum control over the final
printed appearance of your paper. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>SUBMISSION DEADLINE</strong>
<br>The deadline for receipt of your final paper via FTP is Tuesday,
November 3, 1998. This is an ABSOLUTE deadline. Late papers
will NOT be included in the proceedings. To meet the deadline,
we highly recommend that you transmit your file in advance of
the date. Past users of this method have experienced a variety
of transient conditions that delayed successful uploading of
their files (such as network downtime, inability to maintain
a good connection, etc.)--so if at all possible, please beat
the deadline by a couple of days to allow yourself a margin of
error in case there is a problem.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>CONTACT INFORMATION</strong>
<br>If you have any questions, problems, or concerns about the forms
you need to fill out and fax back, the deadline, formatting,
preparation, or the file uploading, please use the following

<br>

<br>Please do not contact Morgan Kaufmann Publishers on any issue relating
<br>to the Proceedings or the Workshop.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>LENGTH REQUIREMENTS</strong>
<br>Poster papers must not exceed 6 pages in length; regular
papers must not exceed 10 pages. Any papers exceeding the allotted
number of pages will not be included in the proceedings.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>PERMISSION TO PUBLISH FORM</strong>
<br>You must download, print out, sign, and fax back to us the 
Permission to Publish form by the deadline of November 3. 
Without this form on file, your paper cannot legally be 
published in the Proceedings.
<br>

<br><a href="perm.ps">Click Here</a> to download a
PostScript version of the form suitable for printing on any
PostScript printer.
<br>

<br><a href="perm.pdf">Click Here</a> to download an
Adobe Acrobat PDF version of the form, which can be printed on
any printer attached to a computer that is running the free
Adobe Reader software.
<br>

<br>Once you have downloaded and printed out this form, you must sign
and fax it back to Professional Book Center at fax number 303-756-5374
by November 3. Keep a copy of the form for your files. We will be unable to include your paper without this written consent. However, note that it is not a copyright transfer document--you and/or the sponsors of your research retain all copyrights in the work. Please be aware that only the lead author need sign this form but he/she is signing it on behalf of all co-authors--check with your co-authors regarding copyright status of the paper before signing the form.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>PRIOR/DUPLICATE PUBLICATION</strong>
<br>If your paper contains material (e.g., a figure) for which you have
transferred copyright to another party (e.g., a journal, publisher, or
society), you will need to obtain permission from that party to include
the work in the proceedings. In this case, you must submit a copy of a
written permission from the journal, publisher, or society, and the
appropriate credit information must appear in your paper.
Contact Jennifer Ballentine at ProBook for information about obtaining
copyright permissions, if necessary.
<br>

<br>Note: if you publish an original paper in the proceedings, this should not
interfere with future publication elsewhere.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>TITLE ABBREVIATION AND AUTHOR NAME FORM FOR INDEX</strong>
<br>Final page numbers and running heads will be assigned and typeset by
ProBook as the papers are received. DO NOT include headers or footers on your formatting of the paper. Sometimes paper titles must be abbreviated in order for the runningheads to fit on the paper. (This abbreviation is for the runninghead only, so the title will not be abbreviated on the title page of the paper.) Use this form to give us your preferred abbreviation for your title, even if you don't think the title will need abbreviation.
<br>

<br>Please also use this form to let us know--if there is likely to be any
question--how your name should be listed in the author index. Some names are quite straightforward (Smith, Jim); others are not so obvious
<br>(van Dyke, Jim alphabetized under ``V'' or ``D''? Epstein Barr, Shiela or Barr, Sheila Epstein?

<br>

<br>
<br><strong>PREPARING YOUR PAPER</strong>
<br>The proceedings format will be 8.5 by 11 inches, two-column. We are striving to produce a uniform, professional appearance, rather than an assortment of differing formats. Please download and print out the following sample format to refer to.

<br>
<br><a href="sample.ps">Click Here</a> to download a
PostScript version of a formatted sample paper suitable for printing on any PostScript printer.

<br>
<br><a href="sample.tex">Click Here</a> to download the tex source of this sample paper.
<br>
<br><a href="sample.pdf">Click Here</a> to download an
Adobe Acrobat PDF version of a formatted sample paper, which can be printed on any printer attached to a computer that is running the free
Adobe Reader software.

<br>
<br>If you use LaTEX, follow the provided LaTEX format style file as closely as possible. If you don't use LaTEX, please follow the formatting instructions on the formatted sample paper for which downloading links are given above to achieve an effect as close as possible to what you see on the sample. If your paper involves a special case not covered by the sample (e.g., four co-authors), use your own best judgment (e.g., repeat two-author style), or contact Jennifer Ballentine at ProBook for advice.

<br>
<br>
<br><strong>REGARDING CONFIRMATION</strong>
<br>Due to the number of conference proceedings papers processed by ProBook, we cannot confirm receipt of individual papers. Please DO NOT CONTACT US TO INQUIRE IF YOUR PAPER HAS BEEN RECEIVED. We will contact you if your paper is not received by the deadline, if there were problems handling your file, or if your materials are not complete.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>DELIVERING YOUR PAPER TO US</strong>
<br>Please read and follow the instructions below carefully.

<br>
<br>(1) Prepare and review your paper exactly as if you intended to physically send it to us.
<br>
<br>
<br>(2) Once your paper is finalized, use your formatting software to make
a single PostScript file for the entire paper. Embed all fonts you use
in the PostScript file (especially any math or special symbol font
information).  Do not compress, zip, or encode your file in any
way. Make sure your file size is less than 1.5 megabytes (it could be
larger if you have embedded graphics).  If it is larger, contact us
via e-mail to discuss the best method for handling the file.
<br>

<br>When preparing graphics, be aware that all papers will be reproduced
at 600dpi--you may wish to downgrade scans or greyscale images
accordingly to result in a final file size under 1.5 megabytes.
<br>
<br>
<br>(3) Use the unique tracking number that the workshop organizers have
assigned to your accepted paper as the filename, followed by the
extension `.ps' for a postscript file or the extension `.pdf' for an
Adobe Acrobat PDF file.
<br>
<br>
<br>(4) Using your ftp client software, open an anonymous session at `ftp.sni.net/morespace3/aistat' and upload your paper into the `incoming' subdirectory. Each ftp software behaves somewhat differently from the rest, so we can't provide specific instructions for everyone.  If you need an example of how to do this, see number (8) below.
<br>
<br>
<br>(5) If possible, please ftp your contribution early--we can begin
accepting papers on October 27. Early submission will also help avoid
overburdening our server with large amounts of incoming data arriving
all at once on the deadline.
<br>
<br>
<br>(6) After you've uploaded your contribution, you must FAX us your
completed Permission to Publish and Title Abbreviation/Author Name
forms.
<br>
<br>
<br>(7) Also after you've uploaded your contribution, please send an
e-mail message to `probook@sni.net' with `AISTAT-98' on the Subject
line, and include the following information: the name of the
PostScript or PDF file that you uploaded to us, the names of the
paper's authors, the exact paper title, and the number of pages in the
paper.  No particular order or format for this information is
necessary.
<br>
<br>
<br>(8) For those not experienced with ftp, you can obtain the freeware
program `ws_ftp' from `www.tucows.com'. Select your platform, then
look through the ftp programs.  Install ws_ftp, connect to the
Internet, and start ws_ftp. Under the `general' tab, enter the address
`ftp.sni.net' in the field HOST NAME/ADDRESS. Check (i.e., tick)
the box `Anonymous.' Under the `startup' tab, enter the path 
`/FTP/morespace3/aistat' (type as shown) in the field Initial Remote Host Directory. Apply, then OK. You will see directories named `incoming' and `outgoing'. Click on `incoming' and on the left side of the window, browse your local system for the file you're uploading.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>
<br>This method does not involve direct electronic delivery of your work
to the public.  Your work will be printed in the hardcopy Proceedings
volume with the other contributions. This electronic delivery method
will not affect your copyright or the publishing use of your material
in any way.
<br>
<br>
<br>Thank you,
<br>
